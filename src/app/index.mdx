Hi, I'm Dhruv.

A pre-final Computer Engineering student from India.

I love exploring new technologies and turning ideas into real-world solutions.

Currently diving into AI, ML and LLMs

Tech, movies, books and philosophy keep me thinking.

Probably web surfing right now.

If you want to chat, vibe, or build something coolâ€”hit me up.
